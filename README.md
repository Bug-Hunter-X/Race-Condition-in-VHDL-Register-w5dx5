This repository demonstrates a subtle race condition in VHDL code that can lead to unpredictable behavior. The `bug.vhdl` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vhdl` provides a corrected version. The race condition arises from the potential for the `data_in` signal to change very close to the rising edge of the clock, resulting in the register capturing an indeterminate value. This is particularly noticeable if `data_in` is not synchronized to the same clock as the register.  The solution uses a synchronizer to ensure that `data_in` is reliably sampled.
